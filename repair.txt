Useful repair information for some PlayStation models

SCPH-102 (PSOne):
When using a wrong polarity and/or wrong voltage power adapter, you will smell something burn. This happens because the black component near the writing D004 on the PCB will literally burn and some fuses will break. As this happened, your PSOne will appear to be dead. To fix this, consider that the power jack on the bottom face of the motherboard has these contacts:

x(gnd)		x(gnd)
           o(7.5v)  

The middle pin is voltage. Solder a wire from o(7.5v) to the first leg of the IC labelled 78M05 (the 7.5v->5v voltage regulator).

Now not far from the voltage regulator there are some fuses laid out in this way:

+-----+
|      a | +--+ +--+ +-----+
+-----+ |  c|  | d |  |       e|
+-----+ |    |  |    |  +-----+
|      b | +--+ +--+
+-----+

I'm using lettering because names will vary between motherboards. Bridge b (general fuse), and bridge d (cd-rom controller fuse). Now your PSOne will start working again. 
If d is not bridged the PSOne will hang after the "Sony Computer Entertainment" screen because the BIOS is trying to communicate with the CD controller and the CD controller is not receiving any voltage.

When not using the original Sony adapter, use only a regulated 7.5v DC power supply with voltage at the center and ground on the barrel.
Anything else is bad for your PSOne.
