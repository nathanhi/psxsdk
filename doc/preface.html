		<big>Preface</big><br>
		In my time developing for the Sony Playstation, I've found that the
		documentation for most things is lacking or even missing.<br>
		As I made this library to make PlayStation development better, I think
		it needs good documentation, so projects can be made in less time
		and be better, and this library can be maintaned better.<br>
		I want the days where you have to search for documentation for hours,
		which once found might even be of dubious legality, to be gone.<br>
