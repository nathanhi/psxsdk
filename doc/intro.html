		<big>Introduction</big><br>
		PSXSDK is a Software Development Kit (SDK). What does this mean?<br>
		It means that it is a collection of programs and libraries with which
		you can make programs and games for your Sony PlayStation console<br>
		<br>
		<big>What do I need?</big><br>
		- A PlayStation console<br>
		A PlayStation 2 will also work, but
		if you want to develop native software for it, you should use a
		native PlayStation 2 SDK.<br>
		Your console has to be preferably modchipped so it can load
		"unauthorized" software. While this is technically illegal under
		laws like the DMCA and EUCD, I think people should have the right
		to execute what they want on THEIR equipment.<br>
		Note that your console doesn't have to be modchipped. It is preferred that it is.<br>
		You can use a boot disc (which is a special disk which is "authorized",
		and which will load a program to load data from home burnt CDs), or you
		can use devices such as Caetla<br>
		I have never tried any of these myself, as my console was already modchipped
		when I bought it.<br>
		<br>
		You can also use a PlayStation emulator, but except for testing your programs,
		it has little point if you do not have a real console.<br>
		<br>
		- A compiler toolchain for little-endian MIPS R3000 with ELF support<br>
		At the official PSXSDK page, you can find a ready-to-go SDK; it is
		likely that you're reading the documentation in one of those.<br>
		Some of the tools shipped in PSXSDK depend on  GCC and Binutils, and it
		is preferred to use those.<br>
		However, in theory, you could use anything which turns C code into little-endian
		MIPS R3000 code.<br>
		<br>
		- A CD-R burner<br>
		95% of CD/DVD drives (as of 2009) are also burners, and will burn CD-Rs.<br>
		<br>
		- Knowledge about the C programming language<br>
		This is mandatory. You will be able to do little if you don't know
		the language quite well.<br>
		You can find tutorials about it on the Internet, or you could learn the
		language from a book.<br>
		It's one of the most common programming languages in
		the world, so knowing it is really useful.<br>
		<br>
		<big>What is included</big><br>
		- libpsx<br>
		This library talks with the Sony PlayStation hardware.<br>
		It contains video, audio and input functions.<br>
		<br>
		- bmp2tim<br>
		Program that converts a Windows Bitmap file to a TIM format image, which
		is the image format used by libpsx.<br>
		This program requires the Allegro library.<br>
		<br>
		- elf2exe<br>
		Program which converts an ELF binary to a PS-X EXE<br>
		This is needed to generate a program file which can be read by the PlayStation
		BIOS<br>
		It uses objdump output, so this depends on GNU Binutils.<br>
