TODO
----------------

- Check division by zero issue. On PCSX nothing is done on division by zero,
   real hardware seems to crash but I think it jumps to an interrupt/exception routine
   which then executes an infinite loop
- Check stuff such as %08x, etc. for sprintf
- QueryPAD uses a workaround to work on buggy emulators.
  If the RX_RDY bit in the SIO status register is checked 1000 times and it
  will never be set, RX_RDY bit checking is disabled. Makes PCSX 1.5 work well.
  On the other hand reading RX_RDY to see when to get joypad data
  works well on real hardware.
  In the future maybe change this to how the BIOS does it, which works
  both on emulators and on the real console.
- Initialize the joypad if the bios does not do so!
  This happens when a joypad is not inserted before the program/game starts,
  and then it is inserted when the program/game runs. The joypad will be not 
  recognized.
