Notes to make games run on real hardware
--------------------
Emulators are often inaccurate or can't emulate some quirk of the real
hardware easily. This is a list of what you mustn't do and what you
should do in order to fix the problem.

Some quirks might even be present only on some revisions of the PlayStation
hardware, but the goal is that something has to run on every revision, and so
one has to respect all the tips, regardless of model.
So if you want to add something to the list, also specify the model it happens
on.

ALL MODELS:

The most noticeable quirk is that the GPU in emulators finishes to draw instantly,
while on the real hardware the GPU has its own speed and so you must wait for
it to finish drawing. The result of this is that on the emulator your program will
run just fine, while on the real hardware the graphics will be entirely scrambled

The way to fix this is to add 

while(GsIsDrawing());

after calls like GsDrawList(), LoadImage(), MoveImage(), etc.
This ensures that your program will first check if the GPU has finished drawing
before doing anything else.

Why doesn't the SDK do this automatically? It is designed more or less to do what
you want to do. If you want to somewhat exploit this quirk to make something nice,
you can.
