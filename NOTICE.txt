This is a SVN version. Most times you will be able to use this without 
any problem, but if it doesn't work, it is completely normal, as it is 
in-development code that is not meant to be in any way complete and that 
is not very tested.

The new APIs of this version are not guaranteed to stay the same ones in 
the next release version of the SDK. Keep this in mind.
Functions already available in the latest release version will, nonetheless, 
try to be backward-compatible. APIs available in release versions can be 
expected not to change, new APIs in a SVN version are a moving target. 

On the other hand this SVN version will probably have features 
and fixes that are not available in the latest release version.
